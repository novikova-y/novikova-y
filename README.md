## Hi, I'm Yulia 👋

I'm a QA engineer with over 8 years of experience in testing. I focus on making QA processes clear and efficient, and I enjoy helping teams collaborate better. I'm always open to learning something new.

### 👩🏻‍💻 What I do
- Ensure product quality by combining structured testing with a curious mindset
- Collaborate closely with developers, PMs, and designers to deliver value, not just features

### 🧠 How I learn
I believe learning is most effective when it's fun! As someone passionate about staying current in tech, I combine humor with hands-on experimentation to keep the process engaging and effective. This mindset helps me continuously improve my skills and approach to QA.
