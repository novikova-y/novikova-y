## Hi, I'm Yulia 👋

Senior QA Engineer with 8+ years of experience delivering quality that drives business success.
I design efficient QA processes that improve team productivity and product quality. Always curious, always learning — focused on business value, not just bugs.

### 👩🏻‍💻 What I do
I ensure product quality by aligning QA efforts with business goals.
My work is not just about testing — it’s about protecting the user experience, supporting fast and confident releases, and helping teams deliver features that matter.

I collaborate closely with developers, PMs, and designers to:
- Design meaningful test strategies rooted in real user behavior  
- Implement scalable, maintainable test automation  
- Reduce risk and improve speed through smart validation, not over-testing

I'm actively learning Playwright and TypeScript through hands-on projects, while experimenting with AI agent flows to better understand and test complex logic.

### 🧠 How I learn
I treat learning as a creative process. From new testing frameworks to AI-assisted workflows, I explore technologies hands-on, always with curiosity and a touch of humor.

### 🎯 What I care about
- Building QA practices that scale with the product  
- Continuous improvement, clear communication, and product intuition  
- Being the voice of the user — even in edge cases
